## Classic Arcade Game Clone

**Project 3: Classic Arcade Game Clone** ~ Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program

In order to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger, we were provided with visual assets, an image loading utility (resources.js) and a game loop engine (engine.js). I created all of the game logic and the code within app.js to add a number of characters to the game, including player, enemies, and gem prizes.

## Getting Started
Navigate to your local copy of index.html through a JavaScript enabled web browser

## Style Guide Used
[Udacity Front-End Style Guide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/)

## Game Rules
1. The goal is to get to the water while avoiding getting hit by the enemy bugs
2. Press the 'ENTER' key to start the game then, use your keyboard arrow keys to move the player up, down, right, left
3. If you reach the water, you gain a star. You'll need a total of 6 stars to win the game
3. If a bug hits you, you lose all your stars, and you have to restart from the initial position
4. If you hit a rock, you'll get a heart and a gem (green, blue or orange) will appear
5. Collect the gem by moving on top of it to gain a key which eradicates one enemy
6. Remember to keep track of your score at the top  
7. Press the 'END' key to refresh game
